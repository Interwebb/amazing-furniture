This project gave me the opportunity to dive deeper into JavaScript, particularly when it came to handling logic, implementing solutions, and custom error handling. It was a challenge at first, but with practice, it's getting better every day. Now, I want to extend this learning experience to the community.

I'm hosting a challenge where you can practice and improve your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You’ll get hands-on experience with:

Semantic HTML: Learn the best practices for structuring web content.
CSS Custom Properties & Responsive Design: Discover how to use relative units, Flexbox, and Grid to create adaptable, user-friendly designs.
JavaScript Logic & Error Handling: Work on real-world scenarios that challenge your problem-solving and implementation skills.
Submit a pull request to participate, share your solutions, and get feedback! It’s a great way to learn, improve, and collaborate with others.

this way you can get to learn a lot of the fundamentals and also level up you skills. However if you feel you have a better approach, using React.JS, tailwindCSS or SCSS with any other Javascript library, then feel free to complete the challenge.
